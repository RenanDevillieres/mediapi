Mediapi is built on a simple idea : who are you serving ? 
Do you have a bias in your userbase ?

The idea spanned with various debates on "who are you serving" in a previous startup.

Features should be centered around :

GENERATE - generate a userbase, under certain constraints (fixed or semi-fixed parameters)

COMPARE - compares an existing userbase to another
