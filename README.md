# mediapi

Mediapi is a fairly simple program aiming at letting people all around the world compare their userbases to various statistics around the world.

It will be kept up to date by fetching the data from various governmental and non-governmental databases.

The syntax has to be automatically detected as much as possible, also the project is free for forking and propositions.

The main goal of this rep is to raise awareness over a simple question : who are you serving exactly ?

Dumping  here the (very rough) versioning I have in mind :

v1.0 (current) : fetch an updated database with statistics, create a representative database
v2.0 : compare any database to any database and give some kind of insights (most obvious example from representative database)
v3.0 : some kind of graphical interface

Please fork, edit, pull !
